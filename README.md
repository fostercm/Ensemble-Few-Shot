This Repo contains some of the files I used to construct an ensemble feature extractor to use for few-shot classification of diabetic retinopathy data during the summer of 2023. It contains my introduction to deep CNN architectures such as Densenets, and their subsequent use alongside other models such as Resnets and VGGs to achieve superior few-shot image classification accuracy.
